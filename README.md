# 👨‍🍳 TasteBud

This project is a **Recipe Application** and was completed as part of the NextJS exercise by Old.St Labs. The purpose of this activity is to improve my skills in building NextJS applications and familiarize with react hooks to manage states. 
Moreover, it also aims to improve my styling skills through the use of Tailwind.
